        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project developed by <strong>x7331</strong> to document the journey of learning the <strong>Kazuya</strong> character in <strong>Tekken 8</strong>. As someone who has just played <strong>MOBA games (Dota and Dota 2)</strong> for over a decade, this is my first foray into fighting games. Everything included here is based on my personal experience and research, so please take it with a <strong>grain of salt</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to create a resource that helps me (and hopefully others) understand Kazuya's moves, combos, and strategies. If you're also learning Kazuya or Tekken 8, feel free to explore the pages and use the information provided. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
