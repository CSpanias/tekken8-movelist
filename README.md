# Tekken 8 Movelist - Kazuya Focus

Welcome to the **Tekken 8 Movelist** project! ðŸŽ® This project is a personal learning tool designed to help you learn **Kazuya's** moves in **Tekken 8**. It provides a sortable and searchable movelist, with the ability to filter by specific character moves (currently just Kazuya). 

This tool is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

## Features

- **Kazuya's Movelist**: All of Kazuya's important moves for Tekken 8.
- **Sortable Columns**: You can sort the movelist by **move name**, **input**, **damage**, **startup**, **hit level**, and **frames on block** by clicking the table headers.
- **Searchable**: Find moves quickly by typing into the search bar.
- **Filter by Character**: Currently only Kazuya's moves are included, but the dropdown allows for easy filtering (in case you expand it to other characters).
- **Easy Data Management**: The movelist data is stored in a **JSON file**, which makes it easy to update as you learn more about the game.

## How to Use

1. **Sort the Movelist**: Click on any of the column headers (e.g., Move Name, Input, Damage, etc.) to sort the list by that column.
2. **Search for Moves**: Type in the search bar to filter moves by name or input.
3. **Character Filter**: Use the dropdown menu to filter the moves (currently just Kazuyaâ€™s moves are available).
4. **Movelist Data**: All of Kazuya's moves are stored in a `data.json` file. You can easily update the data or add more moves by editing this fi
